> *"Back when the grass was green, the sky was blue, and Creepers were your worst nightmare..."*

---

**Betafied** is an **open-source**, **community-driven** project dedicated to recreating the iconic **Minecraft Beta 1.7.3** experience — but for **Bedrock Edition**. The goal is to restore the nostalgic charm of 2011 with classic textures, world generation, mechanics, and more.

> 🔓 Released under the [GNU AGPLv3 License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html#license-text) — tweak it, fork it, build something new — it's yours too.

**Betafied** is more than an addon. **It’s a platform shaped by the community**. Whether you're here for the nostolgia, the code, or to build your own vision, welcome to the Golden Age of Minecraft!
